📱 PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The Skill Swap App is a mobile application frontend built using React Native and designed as a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).
The main idea of this app is to allow users to exchange skills with others instead of paying money.
Users can showcase what they know, browse skill offers, and learn new skills from the community.

This project focuses only on the frontend implementation and uses dummy data for authentication and skill listings.
It demonstrates core mobile app concepts such as navigation, state management, theming, and form handling.
